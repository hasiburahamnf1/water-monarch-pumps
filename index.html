                Reliability and maintenance teams have been experiencing several
                issues. But the most crucial of them is ever-growing skills gap.
                Pump plagued by major faults are to be diagnosed and repaired on
                time. If not done on time, then it will result in a catastrophe.
                Even a single pump failure may cause production to get shut down
                completely in water treatment plants and paper mills. It is for
                this reason it becomes essential to maintain healthy functioning
                pumps. You may perhaps want to know the reasons for 60% pumps to
                fail across the globe.

                • Process issues: Such failures generally occur due to
                improperly selected pump meant for specific operating
                conditions, industrial applications or process. Right pump
                should be chosen for the specific application.

                • Mechanical seal leakage: Leakages mostly tend to occur at
                interface of two seal faces. Besides this, leakages might even
                occur in secondary sealing area. Mechanical seal leakage could
                occur for various reasons. It includes seal ring misalignment,
                thermal distortion and dry running, etc.

                misalignment, etc.

                  The failed component should be replaced to fix the problem
                  instantly. However, doing so does not solve the underlying
                  issue. Other causes might result in certain types of damage.
                  Current might leak onto bearing thereby damaging if pump is
                  grounded improperly. Cavitation is cited to be another
                  example. In this case, seals, impellers and bearings get
                  damaged over time. Replacing damaged parts can offer temporary
                  solution. However, the root problem is not solved like
                  cavitation or grounding issue. The replaced part is likely to
                  fall repeatedly. So, how to determine the root issue before it
                  manifests further. This will only affect your business
                  operations, thereby resulting in huge revenue losses.
